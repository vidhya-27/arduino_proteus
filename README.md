All my small circuits that I simulate using proteus

When an object approaches this device within or equal to 15 cm, the LCD displays the temperature and humidity along with the LDR value. 
If the object is beyond 15 cm, it displays that the distance is out of range.
If LDR value is greater than 100 it displays an alert.
